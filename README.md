## FAQ

##### Q: **My language is not included. Can it be added?**
A: Yes, please open an issue ticket and request a new language.

##### Q: **I am getting an error when loading a particular file in. What can I do?**
A: Try using the GeoRoots Fixer app to determine why is the file not getting accepted. Often times passing the file through the Fixer app will fix the issue. Always doublecheck the accuracy of the resulting features to confirm the original file was not in a different geocoordinate system. (Should be in WGS 84 / Web Mercarod Projection)
